Q: Why is it better to compile the templates for your AngularJS directives in your Ionic app rather than fetching them over HTTP?
-> Because Ionic can't fetch templates over HTTP
-> Because of CORS restrictions
-> So the templates are downloaded when the app is downloaded from the app store - correct
-> So Ionic can serve the templates from a web server running on your phone
-> So you don't have to download the templates until the app is run

In this exercise, you will implement the search view for the mobile app. Similar to the AngularJS chapter's assessment, this view will include a search bar that searches for products by text, that is, using the /api/v1/product/text/:query REST API endpoint.

You will primarily be concerned with writing code that passes the mocha tests specified in the test.js file. Once you implement code that passes these tests, you should be able to start the Ionic CLI with ionic serve --lab and a server with node index.js from the server directory (as long as you copied config.json from the REST API assessment) to see your app in action. However, once again, we recommend implementing your code using the tests rather than eyeballing it in ionic serve --lab.

To complete this assignment, you need to do 2 things:

    You need to add a 'tab.search' state to www/js/app.js that displays the 'templates/tab-search.html' view when the user is directed on the /search URL.
    You need to create a view in 'tab-search.html' that includes the 'searchBar' directive within an ion-view and anion-content directive.

In order to run tests, you should:

    Run npm install in the provided sample code
    Start karma using ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start ./karma.local.conf.js
    Modify www/js/app.js and www/templates/tab-search.html until the tests pass and karma gives you the below output:
